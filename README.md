# Discord Resonance

One bot token, unlimited AI companions. Webhook identity masking lets every companion speak with their own name and avatar in Discord — no per-companion bot accounts needed.

```

1. **Cron** polls watched channels every minute via Discord REST API
2. Messages containing trigger words get stored as **pending commands**
3. Your AI client picks them up via **MCP tools** (or REST)
4. AI generates a response, calls `respond_to_command`
5. Worker dispatches via **Discord webhook** with the companion's name and avatar

The companion speaks as themselves. No one sees the bot account.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (free tier works)
- Node.js 18+
- Wrangler CLI (`npm i -g wrangler`)
- A Discord bot token and webhook

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarisaster/discord-resonance.git
cd discord-resonance
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to **Bot** → create bot, copy the **token**
4. Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
5. Invite the bot to your server with `bot` + `applications.commands` scopes

### Step 3: Create a Webhook

1. In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**
2. Create a new webhook in the channel where companions should speak
3. Copy the webhook URL

### Step 4: Set Secrets

```bash
wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN
# Paste your bot token

wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_URL
# Paste your webhook URL
```

### Step 5: Configure Channels

Edit `wrangler.toml` and set `WATCH_CHANNELS` to the channel IDs you want the bot to monitor (comma-separated):

```toml
[vars]
WATCH_CHANNELS = "123456789,987654321"
```

### Step 6: Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Your bot is live at `https://discord-companion-bot.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`

## Connect Your AI

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add discord-resonance --transport sse https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev/sse
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord-resonance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Antigravity / Streamable HTTP

Use the `/mcp` endpoint:

```
https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev/mcp
```

### REST API

```bash
# Get pending commands
curl https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev/pending

# List companions
curl https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev/api/companions

## Architecture

Built on **Cloudflare Workers** with a **Durable Object** for state management.

```
src/
├── index.ts          # Worker + Durable Object (MCP server, cron, API routes)
├── companions.ts     # Seed data + companion types
└── dashboard.ts      # Dashboard + register page HTML templates
```

- **Durable Object** — SQLite-backed storage for companions, pending commands, sessions, rules, channels, and activity
- **Cron trigger** — polls Discord every minute, detects triggers, stores pending commands
- **MCP server** — 30 tools exposed via SSE and Streamable HTTP transports
- **Webhook dispatch** — responses sent with companion name + avatar via Discord webhooks

---

## Limits

- **10 companions per Discord account** (configurable)
- **~200-500 total companions** comfortable before cron loop needs optimization
- **1 minute** poll interval (Cloudflare cron minimum)
- **DO SQLite** — 1GB storage limit per Durable Object
